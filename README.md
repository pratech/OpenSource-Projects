Open Source Pinwheel Robotics Project
Scratch-Bot by Pinwheel Robotics is a programmable Toy Robot designed for elementary kids.
Who would want to delve into programming things using simple scratch and block based coding.
The Robot should include integrated sensors on the board.
to understand the environment and respond by way of moving wheels, 
wagging tails, blinking eyes, changing color, producing sound. 
The idea is to make the robot interesting and funny for them 
at the same time kids learning to code!
